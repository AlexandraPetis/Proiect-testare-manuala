  ## 1. Introduction
     
OpenCart is free open source e-commerce platform for online merchants. OpenCart provides a professional and reliable foundation from which to build a successful online store. This foundation appeals to a wide variety of users; ranging from seasoned web developers looking for a user-friendly interface to use, to shop owners just launching their business online for the first time. OpenCart has an extensive amount of features that gives you a strong hold over the customization of your store. With OpenCart's tools, you can help your online shop live up to its fullest potential.

### 1.1 Project Objective

We need to raise the trust in the quality of the project as high as possible before releasing it to customers.

The scope of the final project for ITF Manual Testing Course is to use all gained knowledge through the course and apply them in practice, using an available application. 

Application under test:	[https://demo.opencart.com/](https://demo.opencart.com/admin/ ) 

Application documentation:  [Application documentation ](http://docs.opencart.com/en-gb/introduction/)

###  1.2 Functionalities in scope

OpenCart's administration side of the store is where you can modify features, upload images, add products, keep track of customers, manage payments, and much more. Customization in the admin affects how the customer will interact with a store: by modifying the look, structure, and content of the store front.

- The features in scope for testing: modifying the look, structure, content of the store front, upload image files, add multiple language options, can add multiple stores to your admin panel, migrate OpenCart to a new web server,  creat SEO keywords willhelp you to clean up your store page's URL and optimize your page for search engines.
- Testing types used: functional testing, GUI testing

 ### 1.3 Functionalities and tests out of scope
 
- Non-functional testing like stress, performance is beyond scope of this project.
- Only web applications will be tested.
- Automation testing is beyond scope.
  
## 2 Test Process

### 2.1 Test Planning

#### Roles and responsibilities

| Role  | Name  | Tasks/Work |
|---|---|---|
| Tester | Petis Alexandra | will test: login to Opencart, Change the name of the admin folder, Navigate between dashboard, Use Filter to Product list|
| Tester | Andreea Andreea| will test: Change image product, Adding multiple lengauges|

#### Entery criteria:

- functional business specifications are defined
- roles needed for the project are allocated
- testing environment is up and running
- initial project risks were detected and mitigated 
  
#### Exit criteria:

- all test cases have been executed 
- 90% of tests are passed
- no Critical issues/bugs have Open status (All unresolved bugs have low priority and low severity)
- exploratory testing performed on the features
- update tests are 100% passed (update tests will not generate other new issues that impact the application)

#### Risks: 
?

### 2.2 Test analysis

- We plan on running full regression test on the current version 

### 2.3 Test design 

- All the test cases are written and reviewed

### 2.4 Test implementation 

- all the test data is available and reviewed
- this test run includes only regression testing in which we will run tests that have the highest priority, this will be main priority

### 2.5 Test execution

- the tests will be executed on the top 4 used browsers: Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari. if time will be available we will extend tests on Opera and Brave browser

### 2.6 Test closure

-	at least 95% of tests are passed
-	no Critical issues have Open status

### 2.7 Test monitoring and control
